    "# Intro\n",
    "This is a general walkthrough of how to use the Habanero library to retrieve Crossref URLs to fulltext articles, and then download those fulltext articles using Wiley's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prereqs\n",
    "You should have logged in to https://apps.crossref.org/clickthrough/researchers and selected the licenses you are willing to accept. Note institutional licenses supercede these clickthrough licenses, *but* you'll still need to agree to them to get the API keys for those licenses.  You will need to have accepted Wiley's TDM agreement for the purprose of this tutorial.\n",
